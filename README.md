This template is your blank canvas. It comes with a minimal setup to help you get started quickly with Spark development.

🚀 What's Inside?
- A clean, minimal Spark environment
- Pre-configured for local development
- Ready to scale with your ideas
  
🧠 What Can You Do?

Right now, this is just a starting point — the perfect place to begin building and testing your Spark applications.

🧹 Just Exploring?
No problem! If you were just checking things out and don’t need to keep this code:

- Simply delete your Spark.
- Everything will be cleaned up — no traces left behind.

## 🌐 Deploying to GitHub Pages

This template is preconfigured for deployment to GitHub Pages using Vite.

1. Ensure your default branch is `main` (or `master`). The workflow triggers on pushes to either branch.
2. The Vite `base` path is set via the `BASE_PATH` environment variable to `/${REPO_NAME}/` during CI, which makes assets resolve correctly on Pages.
3. A GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds the site and deploys the `dist/` output to GitHub Pages.
4. To deploy manually, push to `main`/`master` or run the **Deploy to GitHub Pages** workflow via the **Actions** tab.
5. After the workflow succeeds, your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.
